                <h3>COFFEE SHOP</h3>
                  <p>“Coffee”. The mere mention of this fragrant beverage completely evokes the senses. A staple of early morning risers, industrious individuals and those with a simple craving for a ‘Cuppa Joe’, this caffeine-laden drink rouses the soul and inspires the mind.

Since joining the human race’s menu over 600-years ago, coffee has been presented in a variety of ways – from the quick-fire espresso, to the elegant café latte; the light city roasts to the darker blends of New Orleans; Columbian flavour to that iconic Italian aroma – one thing is certain: There is good coffee and there is bad coffee.

At The True Blue Coffee Co, we only do good – hell, we’re great at what we do! Our obsessive pursuit of excellence – reflected in years of superb work, passion and dedication – shows in our exceptional selection of fine coffees. Carefully blended, chosen for its unique qualities and premium taste, The True Blue Coffee Co will take you on a leisurely journey through the ages. We believe only in the best coffee available, extensively tried and gleefully tasted… I mean, tested. After all, what’s the point of caffeine-fuelled excellence if it isn’t the best cup of java around?</p>
