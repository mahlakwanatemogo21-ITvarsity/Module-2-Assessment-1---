                <h3>MOS PIZZAS</h3>
                  <p>This is just your typical Boy meets Girl, Boy falls in love with Girl, Boy and Girl join forces as master entrepreneur and master restauranteur to create South Africa’s most loved eatery Story. Their vision was to build a restaurant that would serve only the most mouthwatering Italian inspired meals made with love and the finest, freshest ingredients.

With artisanal wood-fired pizzas, sumptuous pastas and gourmet salads, it was not long before the Col’Cacchio magic spread far and wide. And now, 26 years later, with restaurants all over the country, the mere mention of Col’Cacchio sends taste buds into a wild frenzy. It’s more than a menu. It’s a celebration. A journey. A story, 26 years in the making, of love, passion, adventure and loads and loads of pizza.</p>
